The solution depends on how the uncommon module is built.  If it uses Expo's standard installation, it might already be linked correctly.  However, if it requires manual linking or utilizes a non-standard method, these steps might be necessary:

1. **Verify Installation:** Double-check that the module is correctly installed using `expo install react-native-uncommon-module`.  
2. **Check Module Documentation:** Refer to the specific module's documentation.  Many native modules have special instructions for Expo projects.  These instructions often involve steps beyond just `expo install`.
3. **EAS Build (Recommended):** Consider using Expo's EAS Build service. EAS Build often handles the complexities of native module linking automatically, streamlining the process and eliminating manual linking hassles.
4. **Manual Linking (Advanced & Less Recommended):** For more intricate situations, manual linking might be necessary. This often involves interacting with native (Objective-C/Swift for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android) project files.  This approach is generally discouraged for Expo due to its increased complexity. 
5. **expo prebuild:** Use `expo prebuild` to try building the native project before trying to run the app. This might resolve issues caused by incomplete native linking.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import UncommonModule from 'react-native-uncommon-module'; // Assuming the module is now correctly linked

// ... use UncommonModule here ...
```

**Note:** Always consult the specific module's documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date linking instructions.
